Given a score for a football match represented as a pair of numbers separated by a colon,
work out the points for the home team where:

X:Y

X = home
Y = away

1:1 equals 1 point
2:1 equals 3 points because 2 is greater than 1 
1:2 equals 0 points because the away team scored more

Bonus,

Given a list of fixtures, work out the total points tally for a home team and also the away team.

Your logic should allow for deciding if you want the tally for the home team or the away team.

Team names are not important - because there isnt one :)
