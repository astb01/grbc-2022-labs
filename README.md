# GRBC Labs

## Overview

This repository contains the practical sessions we carried out in the Get Ready Bootcamp 2022.

Each session will have a kata folder and inside an implemention file and a supporting test file.

## Running Tests

You can run tests in two forms. Within each session folder:

```
npm test
```

This will run all tests

Or to also see code coverage:

```
npm run test:coverage
```
